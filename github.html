                <h2> Our experience with Github: </h2> 
                    <p> We find that collaboration in Github had good stucture and with the repositories it was easy to go back to the 
                    projects to know where the code went wrong, however we did run into a few difficulties, such as; </p>  
                <h3> 1. Steep learning curve </h3> 
                    <p> 
                        As new users of the platform, we initially found the setup, navigation, and features to be overwhelming. 
                        With limited prior experience, the learning curve was steep and challenging. In order to resolve difficulties, 
                        we sought help from teaching assistants, our professor, online searches, forums, and by troubleshooting 
                        directly within GitHub. While this process was valuable, it often led to frustration. Our work schedule was 
                        impacted as this caused delays due to insufficient guidance and support resources. 
                    </p>
                <h3> 2. Adapting to collaborative workflow challenges</h3>
                    <p> Collaborating on the project initially felt difficult, as we had to coordinate carefully to avoid working 
                        on the same files simultaneously during pull and push operations. This process was particularly challenging 
                        in the beginning. As we gained experience and improved our communication, we developed a more efficient 
                        workflow that made collaboration easier. 
                    </p>
                <h3> 3. Errors and code review </h3>
                    <p> A significant amount of time was spent resolving errors in our code. These issues frequently arose after 
                        pull and push requests, which themselves were time-consuming. Additionally, we often encountered poorly managed 
                        merge conflicts, further complicating collaboration. For instance, we suffered setbacks when we lost code due to 
                        poorly handled merge conflicts, resulting in additional work and several days of delay.  
                    </p>
                <h3> 4. Pushing flawed code to main repository </h3>
                    <p> There were instances where flawed code was accidentally pushed into the main repository which led to disruptions 
                        within the entire code and layout. Immediate intervention and restoration where necessary to mitigate the impact. 
                        A more efficient system or improved tools for error detection and merge conflict resolution would greatly benefit 
                        teams like ours.
