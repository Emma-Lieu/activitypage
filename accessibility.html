            <section>
                <h3><strong>MatMod page:</strong></h3> 
                <p> 
                    For the Mathematical Modeling and Data Science â€“ Engineering page, we kept OsloMet's characteristic colors to ensure continuity. 
                    Yellow draws attention while evoking a sense of positivity and optimism. Black text was used in contrast with the yellow and 
                    white background to ensure readability. The yellow background was applied selectively to specific sections rather than the entire page, 
                    maintaining readability throughout the site. The chosen fonts: Arial, sans serif and Helvetica were carefully selected to enhance readability, 
                    particularly for users with visual impairments. 
                    Additionally, alternative text for images was utilized to ensure accessibility if the pictures fail to load. Button design was incorporated as 
                    it aligns with several of Donald Norman's key design principles. Gestalt principles were also applied by grouping buttons in close proximity to 
                    create a sense of relationship. We wanted consistency in the button shape and size which strengthens continuity and promotes intuitive interactions. 
                    In order to facilitate an accessible navigation bar for a wide group of users we chose a sticky navigation bar. This particular choice was to 
                    ensure minimal physical effort during navigation.  
                    Menus and buttons featuring a hover effect provides visual feedback, which further enhances the user experience. Lastly, we kept the 
                    underlines for the hyperlinks in order to make navigation clearer and enhance visibility. The icons have low visual complexity, 
                    so their design is universal and recognizable.

            <h3><strong>Activity page:</strong></h3> 
                <p> 
                    This page was designed to have a distinct layout and color scheme compared to the other pages. We selected a nature-inspired color 
                    palette featuring browns and greens, which complemented the hero image we envisioned. However, traditional brown and green tones 
                    can appear washed out or blurry to individuals with colorblindness. To address this, we opted for a magenta-tinged brown that is
                    more colorblind-friendly while preserving the natural aesthetic.
                    To maintain consistency across the page, we implemented CSS root variables for the color palette, ensuring cohesion throughout. 
                    Additionally, we included a sticky navigation bar to allow users to navigate the webpage effortlessly, enhancing the scrolling 
                    experience. The "Pages" dropdown button also features a permanent hover effect to indicate the currently active page, 
                    improving accessibility and universal design.
                    To emphasize important information, we added shadows to the boxes and containers, helping users quickly identify where the content resides. 
                    Images related to activities are placed above the corresponding text boxes to provide visual context before the user begins reading. 
                    To further enhance readability, we incorporated icons where applicable, giving readers a visual preview of the content. 
                    Finally, we selected the "Arial Sans-Serif" font for its superior readability, making the page accessible to older 
                    users and individuals with impaired vision.
